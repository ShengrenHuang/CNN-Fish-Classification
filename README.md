# CNN-Fish-Classification

In this practice, we aim to employ the convolution neural network (CNN) [2] to implement a Fish classification. The classes of the specific fishes lie in 10 kinds, Black Sea Sprat, Gilt-Head Bream, Hourse Mackerel, Red Mullet, Red Sea Bream, Sea Bass, Shrimp, Striped Red Mullet, and Trout. The python package for CNN we use here is PyTorch. The codes are mainly divided into two parts, training and inference part. By referring to [4], the CNN architecture in our code has two convolutional, two max-pooling, and three fully-connected layers with Relu activation functions. The type of training error we adopted here is cross-entropy loss. The training and inference processes run on a desktop computer with CPU: AMD Ryzenâ„¢ 5 3600X, GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 (CUDA available). The fish database [3] is separated into three parts, 60% for training, 20% for testing, and 20% for validation.
